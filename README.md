# Atmega328
Robot Shield Project

This project is a custom-designed hardware shield for a robot that manages power, inputs/outputs, and monitoring. It uses an ATMega328p microcontroller and includes components like a 16 MHz crystal, OLED display, push buttons, 5V buzzer, and a LM2576-5.0 switching regulator to convert 12V battery input to 5V. The shield is compatible with Arduino IDE, allowing easy programming via USB.
